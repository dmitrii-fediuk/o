https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Page_name

#
**Page name** is a **term** that is **used** to **refer** to any **page** that is sent from a **Wikipedia database**. 

#
**Page names** are also the **same** as the **last part of the URL** of Wikipedia pages, that is, after the last slash (/); **except** that **some translation occurs**, such as **spaces being replaced with underscores**. 

# Page Name vs Displayed Title
##
The **page name** is **normally the same** as the **displayed title**, shown on the title line, near the top of the page, in a large font size.

##
The **displayed title** can, however, be **altered slightly** from the page name without affecting things much.
