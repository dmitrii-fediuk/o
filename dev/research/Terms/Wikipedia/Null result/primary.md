https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null_result

In science, a **null result** is **a result without the expected content**: that is, **the proposed result is absent**. 
It is an experimental outcome which does not show an otherwise expected effect. 
This does not imply a result of zero or nothing, simply **a result that does not support the hypothesis**.

In statistical hypothesis testing, a **null result** occurs when an experimental **result** is **not significantly different** from what is to be **expected** under the **null hypothesis**.
