https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planning_fallacy

The planning fallacy is a phenomenon in which **predictions** about how much time will be needed to complete a future task **display an optimism bias** and underestimate the time needed

#
Psychological research also shows that the **planning fallacy** is **partly driven** by **differences** between **how people imagine the future** and **how they recall the past**. 

#
Apart from psychological explanations, the phenomenon of the planning fallacy has also been explained by **Taleb** as resulting from natural **asymmetry** and from **scaling** issues. 
##
The **asymmetry** results from **random events** giving negative results of delay or cost, **not evenly balanced** between **positive** and **negative** results.
##
The **scaling** difficulties relate to the observation that **consequences of disruptions are not linear**, that as size of effort increases the error increases much more as a natural effect of inefficiencies of larger efforts' ability to react, particularly efforts that are not divisible in increments.
