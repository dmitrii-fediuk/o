free variables
An instance of a variable symbol is bound, in contrast, if the value of that variable symbol has been bound to a specific value or range of values in the domain of discourse or universe. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_variables_and_bound_variables#Variable-binding_operators
In mathematics and logic, a number of symbols function as variable-binding operators. These operators take a function or an open formula as an argument and bind a free variable within that expression to a specific domain or range of values, creating a new expression whose meaning does not depend on the bound variable.

A clear example of a variable-binding operator from mathematics is function definition

In English, personal pronouns such as he, she, they, and their variants (e.g., her, him) can function as free variables
