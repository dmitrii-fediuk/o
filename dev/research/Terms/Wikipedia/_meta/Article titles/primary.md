#
Generally, article titles are based on **what the subject is called in reliable sources**. 

#
the **ideal article title precisely identifies the subject**; it is short, natural, distinguishable and recognizable; and resembles titles for similar articles.

#
Article titles are based on how reliable English-language sources refer to the article's subject. 

# 
A good Wikipedia article title has the **5** following **characteristics**:
## Recognizability 
The title is a name or description of the subject that someone familiar with, although not necessarily an expert in, the subject area will recognize.
## Naturalness
The title is one that readers are likely to look or search for and that editors would naturally use to link to the article from other articles. 
Such a title usually conveys what the subject is actually called in English.
## Precision 
The title unambiguously identifies the article's subject and distinguishes it from other subjects. 
## Concision
The title is not longer than necessary to identify the article's subject and distinguish it from other subjects.
## Consistency 
The title is consistent with the pattern of similar articles' titles.
