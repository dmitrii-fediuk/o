# Terminology
**Terminology** is a **group** of **specialized words** and respective **meanings** in a particular field, and also the study of such terms and their use; the latter meaning is also known as terminology science. 

# Term
A **term** is a **word**, **compound word**, or **multi-word expression** that in **specific contexts** is given **specific meanings**—these **may deviate** from the meanings the same words have **in other contexts** and **in everyday language**.

#
**Terminology** **differs** from **lexicography**, as it involves the **study of concepts**, conceptual systems and their labels (terms), whereas lexicography **studies words** and their meanings.
