A **referent** is an **entity** to which a name – a linguistic expression or other symbol – refers.

 For example, in the sentence **Mary saw me**, the **referent** of the **word Mary** is the **particular person called Mary who is being spoken of**, while the referent of the **word me** is the **person uttering the sentence**.
