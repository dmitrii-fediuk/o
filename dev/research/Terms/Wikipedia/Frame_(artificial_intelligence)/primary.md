#
Frames are an artificial intelligence **data structure** used to **divide knowledge** into **substructures** by **representing "stereotyped situations"**.

#
Frame languages have a **significant overlap with object-oriented languages**.  
The terminologies and goals of the two communities were different but as they moved from the academic world and labs to the commercial world developers tended to not care about philosophical issues and focused primarily on specific capabilities, taking the best from either camp regardless of where the idea began. 
What both paradigms have in common is a desire to reduce the distance between concepts in the real world and their implementation in software. 
As such **both paradigms** arrived at the idea of **representing the primary software objects in taxonomies** starting with very general types and progressing to more specific types.

#
For **frame languages** **multiple inheritance** was a **requirement**.
