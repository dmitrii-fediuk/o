https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_value_auction

#
In **common value auctions** the **value of the item for sale** is **identical amongst bidders**, but **bidders have different information about the item's value**. 

#
This stands in **contrast** to a **private value auction** where **each bidder's private valuation of the item is different** and independent of peers' valuations.
