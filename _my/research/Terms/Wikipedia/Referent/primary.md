https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referent

#
A **referent** is an **entity** to which a name – a linguistic expression or other symbol – refers. 

#
 For example, in the sentence **Mary saw me**, the **referent** of the **word Mary** is the **particular person called Mary who is being spoken of**, while the referent of the **word me** is the **person uttering the sentence**.
 
#
In fields such as semantics, semiotics, and the theory of reference, a **distinction** is made between a **referent** and a **reference**.
**Reference** is **a relationship in which a symbol or sign (a word, for example) signifies something**; the **referent** is the **thing signified**. 
The referent may be an actual person or object, or may be something more abstract, such as a set of actions.

#
In logic, a **reference** is a **relationship between objects** in which **one object designates**, or acts as a means by which to connect to or link to, **another object**.
